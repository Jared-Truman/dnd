* Class ([[file:~/.emacs.d/ignore/org-dnd/02.classes.org::Paladin][Paladin]])                                                       :pbh:


* Racial (Centaur)
** Charge.
If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a
melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack
with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.
** Hooves.
Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength
modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

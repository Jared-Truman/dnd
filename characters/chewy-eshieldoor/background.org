The first memories I have are of a hellish wasteland of ice and rock. So expansive,
both low and high, that a being could roam for days and find itself in the same
place. With nothing but the totem I held dear and sparse wrappings of animal hides,
I set off with a sudden urge. A pull towards something I knew yet what but a burning
desire to see. People came and people went. There was Grunge the might half orc
fighter, a fired warrior of the mines but not terribly good at high fives..
Then there was Berry the burley, he was a majestic bear in the prime of life, I
held him in some high regards. Then there was a guy that talked all goofy..
didn't bother to remember his name my spearate coin purses weren't setup to do
so i guess.. So many impacts on me and so many more to come, may the gods of
game watch over me. Look over me oh deity of game and my dear family of adventurers.
It warms me as no fire ever could to learn that the world smiles upon you for yet
another rotation. The happiest of birthdays and the warmest of hugs! May all of
the markets you visit caryy all the whips you desire and may all of the taverns
have a onesie to keep you warm

* Background (Vecna):

Born amidst the towering peaks of the Goliath homeland, Chewy Eshieldoor's earliest memories are of a harsh, unforgiving wasteland of ice and rock. From his first steps on the treacherous paths of his homeland, Chewy was raised in a tight-knit community, learning the ways of survival from seasoned elders and fierce warriors.

With nothing but a totem and sparse wrappings of animal hides, Chewy felt a restless stirring within him, a call to adventure that beckoned beyond the boundaries of his homeland. Equipped with sheer determination and a primal strength inherited from his Goliath lineage, he set off on a journey that would shape his destiny.

Emerging from the depths of dungeons and narrowly escaping death's grasp in encounters with the mad mage's minions, Chewy found himself craving a respite from the constant peril of adventuring. Seeking refuge in the bustling cities that dotted the landscape, he stumbled upon a dojo where warriors honed their skills in hand-to-hand combat.

Intrigued by the disciplined artistry of martial combat, Chewy eagerly immersed himself in the world of pad work and sparring, finding solace in the rhythm of strikes and the camaraderie of fellow fighters. With each session, he honed his reflexes and expanded his repertoire of techniques, embracing the discipline and focus required to master the art.

It was during one of these training sessions that Chewy caught the eye of Midus Fleetfoot, a legendary figure known for his unparalleled speed and agility in the arena. Drawn to Chewy's raw power and tenacity, Midus took the towering Goliath under his wing, recognizing potential in the unlikely pairing.

While Chewy did engage in some sparring sessions with Midus, it was predominantly the pad work sessions that formed the core of their training regimen. With Midus orchestrating the routines, Chewy unleashed his raw strength upon the pads, each strike resonating with the thunderous force of a charging Goliath.

Under Midus's tutelage, Chewy's skills flourished, his towering frame becoming a formidable force to be reckoned with in the arena. Together, they forged a bond that transcended mere mentorship, each drawing strength and inspiration from the other's presence.

As Chewy continued to train and refine his abilities, he found himself drawn not only to the physical aspect of combat but also to the strategic nuances of battle. With Midus's guidance, he learned to anticipate his opponent's movements, to adapt and overcome in the heat of combat.

In the bustling arenas where warriors clashed and legends were born, Chewy found a sense of belonging, a community forged not by blood but by shared passion and determination. And though the world continued to turn and new adventures awaited beyond the horizon, Chewy knew that his place among the champions of old was secured, his legacy written in the annals of history alongside the greats.

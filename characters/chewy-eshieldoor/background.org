The first memories I have are of a hellish wasteland of ice and rock. So expansive, both low and high, that a being could roam for days and find itself in the same place. With nothing but the totem I held dear and sparse wrappings of animal hides, I set off with a sudden urge. A pull towards something I knew yet what but a buring desire to see. People came and people went. There was Grunge the might half orc fighter, a fired warrior of the mines but not terribly good at high fives.. Then there was Berry the burley, he was a majestic bear in the prime of life, I held him in some high regards. Then there was a guy that talked all goofy.. didn't bother to remember his name my spearate coin purses weren't setup to do so i guess.. So many impacts on me and so many more to come, may the gods of game watch over me. Look over me oh deity of game and my dear family of adventurers. It warms me as no fire ever could to learn that the world smiles upon you for yet another rotation. The happiest of birthdays and the warmest of hugs! May all of the markets you visit caryy all the whips you desire and may all of the taverns have a onesie to keep you warm

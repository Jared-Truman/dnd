*** Temnota's Avatarl                                         :divine_gift:
Once per day you can use an action to expend 1 use of your channel divinity and
call upon the powers of the raven queen and cloak yourself within her darkness.
When you do, for 1 minute your entire body becomes draped in shadow and has the
following properties: 

- Erased presence ::
  When in darkness you are invisible and are able to erase your presence. Only a
  creature with True sight is able to see you

- Amorphus ::
  You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing

- Sunlight Weakness ::
  While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks,
  and saving throws

- Advantage against being frightened

Eclipse: As an action you shroud an area you see within 60 feet of you in
darkness (requires concentration), while maintaining concentration you can use
your bonus action on subsequent turns to move the darkness to another point you
can see in range

- Shadow step ::
As a bonus action you can teleport via the shadows choosing a
point within 60 feet of you

- Face of death ::
When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points all other creature's within 30 feet
of you must make a WIS save against your spell DC. On a failed save the creature
is frightened, on a success the creature is immune to this effect until the next
dawn. You gain a number of temp HP equal to your proficiency bonus+ the number
of creatures frightened. Your Allies have ADV against this save and if your in
darkness enemies have disadvantage. 

Once the minute is up you must make a CON save DC 10 on a fail you gain 2 levels
of exhaustion as your body is drained from overexhertion. On a success you
aren't exhausted but the DC increases by 1 each time you succeed. The DC resets
to 10 on a failed save.

* Fighter (Bulwark Warrior)

** PROTECTIVE TAUNT **

Starting at 3rd level, once per turn whenever you make
a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can taunt
them into attacking you. When a creature you've hit since
the start of your last turn attacks someone other than you,
use your reaction to force them to attack you instead. This
effect ends early if they move more than 5 feet out of your
reach, you become incapacitated, or you die.

** WEATHER THE STORM **

Also at 3rd level, you have grown accustomed to being
battered and bruised. As a bonus action, for the next
minute at the end of each of your turns, you can gain
temporary hit points equal to your fighter level. Once
you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
